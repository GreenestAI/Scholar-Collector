abstract: "Optimal operating systems have been widely employed to improve the economic and environmental performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for efficiently treating discharged water pollutants. However, the multi-optimization approach applied to WWTPs has been inadequate, resulting in a low optimization performance owing to varying influent conditions and inherent complex interactions between manipulated variables. Therefore, this study developed a digital multi-solution for optimal operation of a WWTP based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Dynamic influent conditions with low, normal, and high influent chemical oxygen demands and total nitrogen composition ratios were generated using a k-means clustering algorithm to accurately reflect operating conditions. A game abstraction method based on a two-stage attention network (G2ANet) algorithm was employed to simultaneously search â€¦"

abstract: "Detection and isolation of burst locations in water distribution networks (WDN) are challenging problems in urban management because burst events cause considerable economic, social, and environmental losses. In the present study, a novel monitoring and sensor placement approach is proposed for rapid and robust burst detection. Accordingly, a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA) and standardized exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) system is proposed for WDN monitoring and management. In addition, the optimal sensor configuration is obtained using PCA, k-means clustering, and a sensitivity analysis considering the diurnal patterns and the noises of pressure and flowrate data in the WDN. The proposed system is applied to a branched WDN, and the results are compared to those obtained with conventional monitoring systems. The results show that the proposed system detected the burst occurrence regardless of noise size with a detection rate of 93%. Compared to conventional systems, the isolation ratio improved by 10%, indicating that the bursts were isolated more accurately. In addition, the corresponding sensor configuration was 40% less expensive than the conventional systems."

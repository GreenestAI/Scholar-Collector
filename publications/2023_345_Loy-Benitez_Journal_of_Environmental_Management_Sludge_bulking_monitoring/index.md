abstract: "Sludge bulking is a prevalent issue in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that negatively impacts effluent quality by hindering the normal functioning of treatment processes. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel graph-based monitoring framework that employs advanced graph-based techniques to detect and diagnose sludge bulking events. The proposed framework utilizes historical datasets under normal operating conditions to extract pertinent features and causal relationships between process variables. This enables operators to trigger alarms and diagnose the root cause of the bulking event. Sludge bulking detection is carried out using the dynamic graph embedding (DGE) method, which identifies similarities among process variables in both temporal and neighborhood dependencies. Consequently, the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) computes the prior and posterior probabilities of a belief â€¦"

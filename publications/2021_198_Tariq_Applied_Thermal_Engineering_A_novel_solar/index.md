abstract: "Conventional steam-driven multigeneration systems contribute to environmental damage by losing significant freshwater and emitting greenhouse gases. Here, a novel solar-powered steam jet ejector-based multigeneration system independent of external cold utilities is proposed for climate change adaptation. A Rankine cycle, an organic Rankine cycle, and a reverse osmosis desalination unit are fully integrated for clean power, cooling, and freshwater production employing. The thermo-mathematical model was evaluated considering thermodynamic efficiencies, annual costs, exergorisk, and global warming potential in a stand-alone and comparative framework. The water utilization of the hot utility was compared with two traditional fossil fuels by conducting a water-exergy nexus analysis. The analytical results showed that most of the total exergy destruction (73%) occurred in the solar collectors. The proposed â€¦"

abstract: "Wastewater modeling using an activated sludge model (ASM) has been used in water industries but is still known as the difficult and challenging model for full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to its mathematical nonlinearities and the complex interactions between the ASM model parameters. This study suggests a novel autonomous calibration method for the ASM model using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) which can search the feasible parameter spaces and automatically calibrate the kinetic parameters of the ASM model. Eight kinetic parameters in the ASM-soluble microbial product (ASM-SMP) model are selected to be calibrated for describing the biological nutrient removal processes. A game abstraction mechanism based on a two-stage attention network (G2ANet)—one of the MARL algorithms—dynamically suggests the calibrated values of the eight parameters to describe the …"

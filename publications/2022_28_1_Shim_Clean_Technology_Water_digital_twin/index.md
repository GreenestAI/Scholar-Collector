abstract: "Electronics industrial wastewater treatment facilities release organic wastewaters containing high concentrations of organic pollutants and more than 20 toxic non-biodegradable pollutants. One of the major challenges of the fourth industrial revolution era for the electronics industry is how to treat electronics industrial wastewater efficiently. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an electronics industrial wastewater modeling technique that can evaluate the removal efficiency of organic pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), by digital twinning an electronics industrial organic wastewater treatment facility in a cyber physical system (CPS). In this study, an electronics industrial wastewater activated sludge model (e-ASM) was developed based on the theoretical reaction rates for the removal mechanisms of electronics industrial wastewater considering the growth and decay of micro-organisms. The developed e-ASM can model complex biological removal mechanisms, such as the inhibition of nitrification micro-organisms by non-biodegradable organic pollutants including TMAH, as well as the oxidation, nitrification, and denitrification processes. The proposed e-ASM can be implemented as a Water Digital Twin for real electronics industrial wastewater treatment systems and be utilized for process modeling, effluent quality prediction, process selection, and design efficiency across varying influent characteristics on a CPS."

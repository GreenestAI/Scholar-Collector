abstract: "Process systems engineering (PSE) has long been recognized as a critical discipline in chemical engineering for improving process efficiency through mathematical modeling, optimization, and control. The advent of Industry 4.0 has advanced PSE by integrating it with innovative digital tools, including big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. In this context, large language models (LLMs), which are state-of-the-art AI techniques, represent transformative generative AI (GenAI) technologies capable of advancing automation, process optimization, and knowledge extraction in PSE. However, the application of LLMs in PSE is in its nascent stage and is constrained by challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and scalability. Nonetheless, the application of LLMs is expected to foster significant progress in PSE research, including chemical process design, hybrid process modeling â€¦"

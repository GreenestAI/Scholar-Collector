abstract: "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) were invented to treat wastewater pollutants from various industrial sector; in nowadays, it is also required to deal with sustainable efficiency considering energy consumption and environmental benefits under climate change. In this context, autonomous control system for sequencing batch reactor (SBR), which is one of the advanced WWTP, was proposed using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To train the MARL agents, the SBR was modeled based on the activated sludge model No. 1 (ASM1); then various dataset of influent characteristic was generated. A game abstraction method based on a two-stage attention network (G2ANET) algorithm was employed to search the setpoints of aeration and extra carbon (EC) injection for SBR operation. To explain control performance of G2ANET, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) which is one of the explainable AI (XAI) methods was adopted. The result indicated that the G2ANET agents control the SBR to reduce 14.6% of energy consumptions, while maintaining effluent quality criteria. Furthermore, it was guaranteed that the G2ANET agents can recognize the mechanism in SBR operation without human intervention by LRP. Hence the XAI-assisted MARL approach to control SBR system can be applicated to real WWTP with guaranteed control performance considering sustainable efficiency."

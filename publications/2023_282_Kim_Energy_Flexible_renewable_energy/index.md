abstract: "Jeju Island faces curtailment problems when renewable energy generation exceeds the facility capacity. In addition, the renewable energy system cannot achieve consistent operation because of the uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and their complex spatiotemporal patterns. Climate change and extreme meteorological phenomena also affect the energy system of the island. Therefore, it is essential to maximize RES exploitation to accomplish carbon-free energy production. This study developed a rolling horizon optimization–based flexible renewable energy distribution planning (FxRE-Plan) based on an artificial intelligence-driven spatiotemporal RES prediction model. An adaptive graph convolutional recurrent network (AGCRN) was used to develop a spatiotemporal prediction model. Then, FxRE-Plan was determined using a multiobjective genetic algorithm to maximize the RES potential under …"

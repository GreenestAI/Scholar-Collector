abstract: "Sludge bulking affects wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), lowering effluent quality and spreading pollution on discharge areas. The current study proposed a graph-based monitoring framework for sludge bulking events. The proposed outline replaces background knowledge on mechanical-chemical-physical reactions with feature extraction from historical datasets under normal operating conditions and causal relationships between process variables. The dynamic graph embedding (DGE) method extracts similarities among process variables in temporal and neighborhood dependencies, and the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) computes the prior and posterior probabilities of a belief, which are updated for each timestep; changes in these probabilities mark the possible root cause of the sludge bulking event. The DGE outperformed linear and non-linear feature extraction methods with a 98% detection rate, zero false alarms, and 1% misdetections. The DBN-based diagnostic method identified most of the root causes of sludge bulking, governed by sudden COD drops, with 98% accuracy, outperforming state-ofthe-art methods by 11%."

abstract: "Within subway stations, the use of a mechanical ventilation system is a common strategy for improving the indoor air quality (IAQ). These ventilation systems use outdoor air to dilute pollutants on the subway platforms. However, a fixed fan speed in manual subway station ventilation systems does not consider variations in IAQ dynamics caused by disturbances yielded by the outdoor air quality (OAQ). Since the IAQ in subway stations has become a major public health concern, this study aims to analyze the IAQ dynamics at different OAQ conditions to design a new dynamic ventilation control system. The proposed method implemented a Gain Scheduling control strategy over OAQ variations at the D-Subway Station in the Seoul metropolitan area. A set of one feedback (FB) and two feedforward (FF) controllers was implemented. The results showed that the proposed control system tuned with the internal model â€¦"

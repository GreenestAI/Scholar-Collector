abstract: "Indoor air quality (IAQ) measurements play an important role in the subway ventilation system control, influencing over crucial factors as ventilation energy consumption and commuters’ health. Therefore, faulty sensors may result in misinterpreting the IAQ conditions and misoperating the air delivery rate level in subway stations. However, due to the IAQ data properties of dynamism and non-Gaussian distribution. Linear and fixed structures are not sufficient to extract essential features from the IAQ data. This paper presents a machine learning-based soft sensor validation technique to detect, diagnose, identify, and reconstruct faulty measurements of the multivariate IAQ data in subway stations. The proposed method is memory-gated recurrent neural networks-based autoencoders (MG-RNN-AE), which are capable of processing sequential and dynamic IAQ information. The performance of the sensor validation was …"

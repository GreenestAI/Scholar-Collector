abstract: "Simulation study and validation on 50 L/hr pilot-scale Bunsen process was carried out in order to investigate thermodynamics parameters, suitable reactor type, separator configuration, and the optimal conditions of reactors and separation. Sulfur-Iodine is thermochemical process using iodine and sulfur compounds for producing hydrogen from decomposition of water as net reaction. Understanding in phase separation and reaction of Bunsen Process is crucial since Bunsen Process acts as an intermediate process among three reactions. Electrolyte Non-Random Two-Liquid model is implemented in simulation as thermodynamic model. The simulation results are validated with the thermodynamic parameters and the 50 L/hr pilot-scale experimental data. The SO 2 conversions of PFR and CSTR were compared as varying the temperature and reactor volume in order to investigate suitable type of reactor. Impurities in H 2 SO 4 phase and HI X phase were investigated for 3-phase separator (vapor-liquid-liquid) and two 2-phase separators (vapor-liquid & liquid-liquid) in order to select separation configuration with better performance. The process optimization on reactor and phase separator is carried out to find the operating conditions and feed conditions that can reach the maximum SO 2 conversion and the minimum H 2 SO 4 impurities in HI X phase. For reactor optimization, the maximum 98% SO 2 conversion was obtained with fixed iodine and water inlet flow rate when the diameter and length of PFR reactor are 0.20 m and 7.6 m. Inlet water and iodine flow rate is reduced by 17% and 22% to reach the maximum 10% SO 2 conversion with fixed â€¦"

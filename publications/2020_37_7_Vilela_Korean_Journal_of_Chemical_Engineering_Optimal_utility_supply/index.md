abstract: "A two-objective, two-stage mathematical model was developed considering demand uncertainty and operational risk assessment in constructing a utility supply network for steam generation and steam exchange in a petrochemical industrial park. This study defined two objective functions, the total economic cost and risk cost, where the demand uncertainty enhanced the reliability of the utility network design. The economic and risk cost present a holistic study, where the actual operation cost and additional costs in case of industrial operation failure can be determined. For this, two stages were established for both objective functions, a deterministic stage and a stochastic stage. The deterministic stage fixed the parameter values for the optimization problem, while the stochastic stage included the steam supply-demand uncertainty. A case study of the Yeosu industrial park in South Korea was used to show the â€¦"

abstract: "In the water industry, a state-of-the-art membrane bioreactor (MBR) requires relatively high operation expenditures due to foulants continually accumulating and clogging the surface and pores of the membrane. Hence, with the advent of digital innovations, developing an innovative tool based on data-driven approaches for membrane maintenance is important and challenging issue to achieve sustainable MBR operations. We developed a digitally-transformed early-warning protocol (DT-EWP) for membrane cleaning by predicting, diagnosing, and producing a warning for biofouling phenomena in a full-scale MBR plant. Biofouling progress was recursively predicted utilizing Kalman filter method and then performed diagnosis to identify the dominant fouling mechanism, incorporating genetic algorithm. In addition, membrane cleaning warning rule based on fouling-cumulative sum (FCUSUM) control chart was â€¦"

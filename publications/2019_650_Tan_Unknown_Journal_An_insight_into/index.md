abstract: "Nanocellulose, a structural polysaccharide that has caught tremendous interests nowadays due to its renewability, inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, abundance in resource, and environmental friendly nature. They are promising green nanomaterials derived from cellulosic biomass that can be disintegrated into cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) or cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), relying on their sensitivity to hydrolysis at the axial spacing of disordered domains. Owing to their unique mesoscopic characteristics at nanoscale, nanocellulose has been widely researched and incorporated as a reinforcement material in composite materials. The world has been consuming the natural resources at a much higher speed than the environment could regenerate. Today, as an uprising candidate in soft condensed matter physics, a growing interest was received owing to its unique self-assembly behaviour and quantum â€¦"

abstract: "Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are widely employed in wastewater treatment for their superior performance, though maintaining membrane efficiency remains costly and energy-intensive because of fouling accumulation. This study introduces a novel membrane-informed predictive maintenance (membrane-PM) system that accurately predicts cleaning intervals for membrane fouling in a full-scale MBR plant. By integrating biologically informed, physically deposited, and chemically induced fouling data via an activated sludge model, resistance-in-series model, and multiple linear regression model, we captured the complex dynamics of fouling. A day-to-day calibration approach, utilizing global sensitivity analysis and a genetic algorithm (GA), improves model precision by reflecting temporal fouling changes. Additionally, membrane-informed multivariate statistical monitoring (membrane-MSM), based on Hotelling's â€¦"

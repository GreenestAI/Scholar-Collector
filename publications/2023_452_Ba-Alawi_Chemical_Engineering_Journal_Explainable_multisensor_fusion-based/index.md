abstract: "A membrane bioreactor (MBR) is a crucial wastewater treatment unit that requires continuous and precise monitoring to ensure stable operation and avoid energy loss. Sensor malfunction in MBR plants leads to missing and faulty measurements that negatively affect the control of membrane fouling and energy consumption. This study proposes an intelligent monitoring system to alleviate membrane fouling by the autonomous handling of sensor malfunctions in MBR plants using explainable AI (XAI) and a new multisensor fusion-based automated data reconciliation and imputation (MSF-ARI) approach. Missing and faulty data cases were used to validate the MSF-ARI approach in imputing the consecutive and point-to-point missing values and the detection, diagnosis, and reconciliation of the faulty data. Then, XAI analysis and an integrated biological-physical MBR model were utilized to evaluate the effect of MSF â€¦"

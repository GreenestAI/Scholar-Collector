abstract: "Our goal in this study was to design a hydrogen supply network to efficiently produce and manage hydrogen in case future hydrogen demand increases. Sludge from wastewater treatment plants can be converted into biogas using an anaerobic digestion process, and the generated biogas can be transformed into biomethane by amine technology as a biogas upgrading method. A cascade of four-associated technologies (COFAT) is developed in the proposed model as biomethane is converted into hydrogen by employing a biomethane-based steam reforming process. The suggested COFAT system which is not dependent on fossil fuels is integrated with a conventional steam methane reforming process and harnesses large amounts of hydrogen. Hydrogen management is performed using a hydrogen storage tank to meet regional hydrogen demand, and a hydrogen transport network is constructed using pipelines â€¦"

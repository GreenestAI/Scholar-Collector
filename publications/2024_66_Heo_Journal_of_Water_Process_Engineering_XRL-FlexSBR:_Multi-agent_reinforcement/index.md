abstract: "The sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process stands out for its small footprint and operational flexibility. However, the SBR process is highly nonlinear and subject to influent disturbances. In this study, we suggested an explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning (XRL) approach coupled with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and explainable AI (XAI); then, an XRL-driven flexible SBR control (XRL-FlexSBR) system was developed to conduct multivariate control the SBR process autonomously. Influent big datasets including biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total nitrogen (TN) were collected from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of South Korea. Then, the Gaussian mixture model was utilized to cluster the diverse influent conditions and the SBR mechanistic model was developed. A game abstraction method based on a two-stage attention network (G2ANET), one of MARL algorithms, was â€¦"

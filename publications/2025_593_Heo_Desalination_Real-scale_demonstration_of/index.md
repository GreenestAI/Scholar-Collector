abstract: "Partial nitritation (PN) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) process is a promising energy-efficient nitrogen removal method in wastewater sector. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven process operation techniques are widely researched. However, there is few research to demonstrate AI application into a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) due to operational complexity of WWTP. This study conducts a real-scale demonstration of digital twin-based aeration control policy (DT-O2CTRL) to autonomously control the full-scale PN/A process under high nitrogen influent loads. For this, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4-N in influent and reactors, were collected through the online sensors. Then, digital twin (DT) model of full-scale PN/A process was mathematically developed. Finally, policy iterative dynamic programming (PIDP), inspired from the reinforcement learning, was suggested as â€¦"

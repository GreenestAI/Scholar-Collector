abstract: "In alignment with climate change mitigation plans, renewable and sustainable energy integration into the industrial sector should be investigated for decarbonization purposes by 2050. This study aims to examine the feasibility of decarbonization of mega-scale industrial parks with two emerging technologies; first, an integrated energy system involving an air separation unit (ASU) and a liquid air energy storage (LAES)-based power generation system (ALPG) with the assistance of a large-scale liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and second, the green electricity predicted by various renewable energy (VRE) scenarios using an AI-driven generative model concerning techno-economic and environmental analyses. Firstly, the electricity demand of mega-scale petrochemical industrial complexes was allocated, and remote sensing data of VRE (wind and solar) were collected in South Korea. Then, the ALPG was modeled â€¦"

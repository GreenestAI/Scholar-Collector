abstract: "초록 (Abstract) Excessive nitrogen content in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents would lead to adverse environmental effects. Conventional biological treatment for nitrogen removal require high operation costs. Therein, a practical approach combining partial nitrification with Annamox process is proposed which allowed to reduce the oxygen and carbon input that required in nitrification and denitrification, respectively. Yet, main objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model for partial nitrification only which operating in batch behavior. General operation modes of this process are consists of input, aeration, settling, and discharge. The aeration time would be altered across different phases to achieve optimal ratio of NO2: NH4 before the entry to Anammox process. The suggested model is validated by comparing the simulation results with an experimental result from pilot-scale WWTP operating …"

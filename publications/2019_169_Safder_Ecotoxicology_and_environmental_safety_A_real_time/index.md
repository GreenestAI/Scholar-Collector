abstract: "A fine particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (PM 2.5) in the underground subway system are the cause of many diseases. The iron containing PMs frequently confront in underground stations, which ultimately have an impact on the health of living beings especially in children. Hence, it is necessary to conduct toxicity assessment of chemical species and regularized the indoor air pollutants to ensure the good health of children. Therefore, in this study, a new indoor air quality (IAQ) index is proposed based on toxicity assessment by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The new indices called comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CIAT) and cumulative comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CCIAT) suggests the new standards based on toxicity assessment of PM 2.5. QSAR based deep neural network (DNN) exhibited the best model in predicting the toxicity assessment of chemical species in particulate …"

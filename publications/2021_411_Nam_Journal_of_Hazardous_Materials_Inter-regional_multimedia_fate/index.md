abstract: "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are hazardous compounds associated with respiratory disease and lung cancer. Increasing fossil fuel consumption, which causes climate change, has accelerated the emissions of PAHs. However, potential risks by PAHs have not been predicted for Korea, and appropriate PAH regulations under climate change have yet to be developed. This study assesses the potential risks posed by PAHs using climate change scenarios based on deep learning, and a multimedia fugacity model was employed to describe the future fate of PAHs. The multimedia fugacity model describes the dynamics of sixteen PAHs by reflecting inter-regional meteorological transportation. A deep neural network predicts future environmental and economic conditions, and the potential risks posed by PAHs, in the year 2050, using a prediction model and climate change scenarios. The assessment â€¦"

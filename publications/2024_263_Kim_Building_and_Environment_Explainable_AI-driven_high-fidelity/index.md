abstract: "Indoor air quality (IAQ) in underground subway stations is an emerging concern regarding the health of passengers. Outdoor air quality (OAQ) is strongly correlated with IAQ; thus, indoor air should be considered comprehensively with outdoor air. However, lack of OAQ monitoring stations resulted no outdoor measurements at various subway stations. To tackle this issue, the high-fidelity IAQ prediction (HiFi-IAQ) model was developed with spatiotemporal OAQ interpolation using geographic information system (GIS). First, a city-wide OAQ measurements were collected, and a graph convolutional network (GCN) model was developed to interpolate spatiotemporal OAQ at a target subway station. Based on the interpolated GIS-driven OAQ (InterGIS-OAQ), the HiFi-IAQ model was developed and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) was used for the interpretation and improvement of the fidelity of a model. The results â€¦"

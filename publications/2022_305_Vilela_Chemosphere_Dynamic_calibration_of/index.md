abstract: "A main challenge in rapid nitrogen removal from rejected water in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is growth of biomass by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In this study, partial nitritation (PN) coupled with air-lift granular unit (AGU) technology was applied to enhance nitrogen-removal efficiency in WWTPs. For successful PN process at high-nitrogen-influent conditions, a pH of 7.5–8 for high free-ammonia concentrations and AOB for growth of total bacterial populations are required. The PN process in a sequential batch reactor (SBR) with AGU was modeled as an activated sludge model (ASM), and dynamic calibration using full-scale plant data was performed to enhance aeration in the reactor and improve the nitrite-to-ammonia ratio in the PN effluent. In steady-state and dynamic calibrations, the measured and modeled values of the output were in close agreement …"

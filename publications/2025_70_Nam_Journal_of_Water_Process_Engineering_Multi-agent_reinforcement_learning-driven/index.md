abstract: "An aeration system is vital in wastewater treatment plants because it supplies dissolved oxygen (DO) to microorganisms to treat wastewater and consumes the most energy among the processes. Thus, accurate and robust aeration using a controller is essential for operating wastewater treatment processes efficiently. This study proposes a novel auto-adaptive controller tuning system using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which can simultaneously tune the tree-tuning parameters of a proportional-integral-derivative controller. The MARL structure includes a joint reward interpreter that enables agents to cooperate with centralized training to minimize the controller error. The main algorithm as an advantage-weighted actor-critic (AWAC). AWAC is a data-centric offline approach that can update its policy in a safer and more accurate manner using collected data, unlike online RL approaches that require a â€¦"

abstract: "Modern subway transport has become the primary mode of travel for millions of commuters, while indoor air quality (IAQ) in subway stations is becoming a major public health concern. The IAQ management in subway stations is governed by a rule-based ventilation strategy, consisting on the introduction of fresh air from outside. However, this strategy does not consider the IAQ dynamics under time-variant outdoor conditions. Alongside, the sizeable inherent time-delay of the subway IAQ system limits the performance of feedback controllers in the ventilation system. Therefore, a time-delay compensated gain-scheduled (TDC-GS) ventilation system based on the Smith Predictor (SP) is proposed to address the time-delay of the IAQ process. This strategy was assessed for various outdoor air conditions. The performance of the control systems was analyzed under two case studies consisting of good, moderate and â€¦"

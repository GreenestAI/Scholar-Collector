abstract: "The rising demand from consumer goods and pharmaceutical industry is driving a fast expansion of newly developed chemicals. The conventional toxicity testing of unknown chemicals is expensive, time-consuming, and raises ethical concerns. The quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) is an efficient computational method because it saves time, resources, and animal experimentation. Advances in machine learning have improved chemical analysis in QSPR studies, but the real-world application of machine learning-based QSPR studies was limited by the unexplainable ‘black box’ feature of the machine learnings. In this study, multi-encoder structure-to-toxicity (S2T)-transformer based QSPR model was developed to estimate the properties of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Simplified molecular input line entry systems (SMILES) and molecular …"

abstract: "Electricity generation from renewable resources such as wind and solar energy inevitably involve intermittency due to the variable nature of wind speed and solar radiation. In this study, a mathematical model of a hydrogen-based self-sustaining integrated renewable electricity network (HySIREN) employing a supply-demand forecasting model and deep-learning (DL) algorithms is developed. The proposed model is implemented as follows: an empirical model decomposition is applied to decompose historical renewable electricity supply-demand data into a number of sub-layers; DL models are utilized to predict renewable electricity supply-demand patterns using the disclosed sub-layers; the predicted surplus renewable electricity and the predicted renewable electricity shortage are explicitly divided through a comparison of forecasting renewable electricity supply-demand data; and according to the results from â€¦"

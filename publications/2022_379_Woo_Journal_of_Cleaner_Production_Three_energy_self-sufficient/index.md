abstract: "Classical consumer communities are gradually turning to energy prosumers who employ innovative and self-sufficient systems. Despite the importance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in environmental protection and public health, they still consume considerable energy. This study employs bi-level nonlinear optimization models and a systematic platform of four novel techniques to design an energy self-sufficient network of WWTPs on Jeju Island, South Korea. A systematic platform consisting of four novel techniques is employed for designing energy self-sufficient WWTPs. The four techniques are dehydration of generated biogas from an anaerobic digestion, a nonlinear thermo-mathematical program for maximizing the generated electricity per input sludge, a deficit-surplus trade to avoid storage usage, and a bi-level multi-integer nonlinear program for optimal sizing of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Three self â€¦"

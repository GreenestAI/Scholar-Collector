abstract: "Energy hub concept has been applied to energy management systems to enhance system flexibility. However, energy management studies face various challenges due to demand uncertainties, system complexity, and interactions between different energy carriers in energy hubs. This study considers smart operational strategies for a novel green energy hub (GEH) to supply power and heat to a commercial community. To handle demand uncertainty, a fusion autoencoder (FAE) model was used to reconstruct any abnormalities in demand data. To enhance flexibility, the GEH is equipped with storage facilities, including a battery bank and thermal storage. The scheduling of the GEH was optimized using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) model. This approach considers a balance between centralized training and decentralized dispatch to minimize the total cost of the GEH system while meeting demand â€¦"

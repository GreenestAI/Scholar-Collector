abstract: "Mechanical ventilation has been widely implemented to alleviate poor indoor air quality (IAQ) in confined underground public facilities. However, due to time-varying IAQ properties that are influenced by unpredictable factors, including outdoor air quality, subway schedules, and passenger volumes, real-time control that incorporates a trade-off between energy saving and IAQ is limited in conventional rule-based and model-based approaches. We propose a data-driven and intelligent approach for a smart ventilation control system based on a deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) algorithm. This study utilized a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm of DeepRL to design the ventilation system. The DQN agent was trained in a virtual environment defined by a gray-box model to simulate an IAQ system in a subway station. Performance of the proposed method over three weeks was evaluated by a comprehensive indoor â€¦"

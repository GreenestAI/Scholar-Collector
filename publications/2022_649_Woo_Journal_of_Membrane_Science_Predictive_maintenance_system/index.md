abstract: "The significant operational cost of membrane maintenance is an important issue to overcome alongside the membrane replacement time. We propose a membrane lifetime estimation method via functional machine learning (FML) using 12 biological-chemical-physical functional parameters and a predictive maintenance system for membrane replacement based on AI-driven functional profile monitoring (FPM). Biological, chemical, and physical information regarding membrane aging were reflected in the 12 functional parameters extracted from transmembrane pressure (TMP) and the chemical dosage. Membrane aging was diagnosed using hidden patterns and trends in the functional parameters, then the membrane lifetime was estimated by interpreting their relationships using FML. Influential functional parameters regarding membrane lifetime were monitored using FPM, and membrane replacement time was â€¦"

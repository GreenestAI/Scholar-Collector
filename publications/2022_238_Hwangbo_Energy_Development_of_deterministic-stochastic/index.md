abstract: "This paper aims to develop the mathematical model of electricity based on renewable energy and large-scale utility (eRELU) networks to achieve a low-carbon economy. Huge petrochemical industries allocated in South Korea are considered to evaluate the proposed model by techno-economic and environmental assessment subject to Korean renewable energy policy. The suggested mathematical model consists of two parts: the deterministic model to optimize industrial-scale utility networks and the stochastic model to construct clean electricity networks using variable renewable energy coupled with energy storage systems to provide feasible quantities of renewable electricity required from the optimized utility network. The resulting model is complemented by carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems in doing so the inevitable amount of greenhouse gases from boilers in utility networks can be significantly â€¦"

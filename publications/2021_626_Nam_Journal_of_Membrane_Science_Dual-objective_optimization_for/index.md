abstract: "Optimal operational strategies for wastewater treatment plants have been employed widely to improve the economic and environmental operations. However, inadequate optimization systems have been applied to membrane bioreactor (MBR) plants, resulting in high energy consumption due to uncertain influent associated with complex biological and physical interactions associated with membrane fouling. Here, we develop a dual-objective optimization system based on harmony search algorithm via process simulation. A bidirectional gated recurrent unit produced the most accurate predictions of fluctuating variations in hourly influent among competing models. And the predicted influent information was used to suggest operational strategies. The optimization system searched predictive operational strategies, including aeration intensities and permeation-cleaning durations, using the integrated biological and â€¦"

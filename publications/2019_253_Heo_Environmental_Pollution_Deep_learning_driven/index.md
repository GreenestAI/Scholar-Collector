abstract: "Over 80,000 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are considered emerging contaminants (ECs), which are of great concern due to their effects on human health. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models are a promising alternative to in vitro methods to predict the toxicological effects of chemicals on human health. In this study, we assessed a deep-learning based QSAR (DL-QSAR) model to predict the qualitative and the quantitative effects of EDCs on the human endocrine system, and especially sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and estrogen receptor (ER). Statistical analyses of the qualitative responses indicated that the accuracies of all three DL-QSAR methods were above 90%, and greater than the other statistical and machine learning models, indicating excellent classification performance. The quantitative analyses, as assessed using deep-neural-network-based QSAR (DNN-QSAR â€¦"

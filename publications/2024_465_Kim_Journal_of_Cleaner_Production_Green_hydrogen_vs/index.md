abstract: "Recent global trends have increasingly focused on sustainable and green energy solutions,transitioning away from fossil fuels. Green hydrogen (GH) and green ammonia (GA) have emerged as promising contenders for energy carriers in international supply chains. Our manuscript delivers a thorough comparative analysis of GH and GA, acknowledging the complex interrelations among synthesis, storage, distribution, and conversion processes. This evaluation also incorporates the variability of weather, energy demand, and the delays inherent in shipping, on both hourly and seasonal scales. The study features a detailed case analysis of nine international trading routes, utilizing a hierarchical optimization framework and conducting comparative economic evaluations. Additionally, the study delves into a sensitivity analysis, exploring factors such as economies of scale and the operational constraints of water â€¦"

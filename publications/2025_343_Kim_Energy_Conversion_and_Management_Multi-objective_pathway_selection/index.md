abstract: "Microalgae are recognized for their rapid growth rate and serve as an efficient biofuel production feedstock to address critical sustainability and energy security challenges. However, the primary challenge for stable biorefinery operations lies in the cultivation phase, as microalgae growth is highly dependent on time-varying climatic conditions. This work presents an optimal biorefinery process pathway to address this issue by integrating economic and environmental considerations with harvest scheduling under fluctuating climate conditions. In the first stage, a kinetic growth model was developed for eight microalgae species, incorporating temperature and solar radiation data. Harvest scheduling was then optimized using a genetic algorithm to find the optimal harvest interval for each microalgae species, maximizing the biomass yield under time-varying climate conditions. Subsequently, a multi-objective â€¦"

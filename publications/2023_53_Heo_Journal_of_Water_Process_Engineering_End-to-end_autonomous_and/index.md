abstract: "This study developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven autonomous resilient operation of partial nitrification (PN) process to enhance the performance of a two-stage PN-anammox process by ensuring a specific NO2/NH4 ratio under varying influent conditions before the wastewater enters the subsequent anammox process. First, a mathematical model representing PN process was developed in a full-scale sequencing batch reactor (PN-SBR). That model was then calibrated using AI-driven multi-objective optimization targeting NH4, NO2, and NO3 using a comprehensive rank-based global sensitivity analysis framework to identify the biological kinetic and stoichiometric parameters that has high affection on the PN process. After validating the PN-SBR model with real-time measurements of the PN process, an AI-driven optimal aeration strategy (AI-OpAS) was developed for the targeted PN-SBR. The influent â€¦"

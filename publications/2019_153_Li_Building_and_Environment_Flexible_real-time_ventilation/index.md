abstract: "Indoor air quality (IAQ) in subway stations are dynamic due to various time-dependent factors, such as subway schedule, passenger load variance in short time scale, and outdoor air quality variation cause from climate change. To remove the indoor pollutants, a conventional mechanical ventilation system is typically utilized in subway stations; however, the working mechanism does not consider the real-time variation of the factors that may cause energy waste or deficiency. Therefore, for a quick response in controlling the time-varying indoor PM10 concentration and to design a well-adapted control system for various outdoor air quality (OAQ), a flexible optimal real-time ventilation control strategy was developed. Moreover, the optimal set-points of the PM10 concentration in the platform are determined by the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) at different time intervals to keep a balance of the energy â€¦"

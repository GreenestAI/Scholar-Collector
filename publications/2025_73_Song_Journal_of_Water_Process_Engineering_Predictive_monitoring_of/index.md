abstract: "Biological treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) require effective monitoring systems to rapidly detect process anomalies and identify causes. Traditional statistical approaches struggle with capturing dynamic microorganism characteristics influenced by seasonal variations and fluctuating conditions. To address this, a predictive and adaptive water quality monitoring system was developed, integrating an adaptive quality monitoring chart (AQUA) with a water quality auto-regressive variational mode enhanced model (WAVE). The WAVE model combines partial least-squares regression, autoregression, and variational mode decomposition to capture temporal and seasonal dynamics in microbial activity. Data from a full-scale M-city WWTP were analyzed to identify significant features and seasonal patterns. The WAVE model showed high prediction performances for chemical oxygen demand â€¦"

abstract: "New emerging wastewater treatment technologies like bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) and membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have been introduced in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for producing energy and treating urban wastewater. This study compares WWTPs that combine new emerging technologies of membrane bioreactors (MBRs), microbial fuel cells (MFCs), and microbial electrolysis (MEC) with the conventional techniques (anaerobic, anoxic, and oxic, A2O). The environmental and economic impacts of the combined emerging treatment technologies are evaluated. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic assessment of the total cost considering both capital and operating cost are performed to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts, respectively. The environmental impact evaluation demonstrated that A2O + MBR and A2O + MFC processes are the most environmentally …"

abstract: "An emerging renewable energy source from living organisms, microalgae are recognized for its remarkable energy content and continuously receiving interest with a great potential in increasing its shares in fuel market. The main challenge for stable biorefinery operation is cultivation, given that the growth of microalgae is highly dependent on climate conditions, especially ambient temperature, and solar exposure. Herein, an advanced forecasting algorithm predicts daily climate conditions a year ahead. The forecast is then used in a dynamic metaheuristic optimization framework to determine optimal microalgae biorefinery process pathways with promising total annual margins and greenhouse gas emissions. In return, the optimal solution is reported with a total annual margin of 815,716 US$/y and greenhouse gas emission of 1.1 × 107 kg CO2-eqv/y. The most feasible microalgae species among the selection pool …"

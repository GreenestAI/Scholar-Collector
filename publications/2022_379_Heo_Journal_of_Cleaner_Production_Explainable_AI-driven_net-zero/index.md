abstract: "Recently, several countries have focused on industrial decarbonization to ensure that the net emissions of carbon dioxide reach zero and contribute to decreasing the global mean temperature. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a net-zero carbon roadmap for the petrochemical industry by 1) developing an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based generative model to produce stochastic scenarios for offshore wind power in an electrical grid, and 2) conducting techno-economic and environmental assessments for forecasting models that define offshore wind power networks. Firstly, data processing techniques were utilized on remotely sensed offshore wind speed datasets and energy data obtained from petrochemical industrial parks. Second, a generative model was designed using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to produce different forecast scenarios of offshore wind power. Third, stochastic â€¦"

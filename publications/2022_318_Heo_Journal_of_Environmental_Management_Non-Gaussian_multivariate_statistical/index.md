abstract: "The spatial and temporal variability of renewable energy resources, particularly wind energy, should be statistically evaluated to achieve sustainable economic development to mitigate climate change. In this study, a non-Gaussian multivariate statistical monitoring approach is proposed to investigate the wind speed frequencies across different regions of South Korea. Anemometer data were first collected in 11 different provinces of South Korea with hourly resolution for one year. The best-of-fit for the corresponding distribution function was identified to characterize the behavior of the wind speed frequency at each region among more than 60 candidate functions using the chi-squared test. Furthermore, a non-Gaussian multivariate statistical monitoring method based on the Hotelling T2 chart was developed to spatially and temporally analyze the physical patterns of the wind speed frequencies using the estimated â€¦"

abstract: "Korean government has highlighted hydrogen (H2) utilization in various sector to substitute fossil-fired energy resources. However, H2 production has relied on as byproduct from petrochemical industry yet; sustainable hydrogen production methods should be developed and utilized for clean energy transition. This study aims to examine implementable wastewater-to-H2 production technologies via biogas from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) based on techno-economic assessment (TEA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA). WWTP treat mainly organic pollutants which include rich carbon source for bioenergy production; furthermore, anaerobic digestion (AD) in WWTP has a large potential to product H2 via biogas. Various H2 production pathways combining biogas upgradation, hydrogen production, and carbon capturing systems were compared to search sustainable pathway towards circular hydrogen economy in South Korea. Then national-wide supply and demand scenario through 2050 was analyzed based on the wastewater big dataset from more than 3,000 WWTPs in South Korea. The results verified that BUS-TRMre-CCS which combines tri-reforming of methane with flue gas recycling, water scrubbing, and carbon capturing system was assessed as the best candidate for wastewater-to-H2 production because it can produce the hydrogen as 4.49$/kg H2 and GHG potential of 8.14 kgCO2-eq/kgH2. This H2 production pathway has competitiveness comparing to conventional off-site H2 production due to on-site H2 production in WWTPs across South Korea. In alignment with strict action towards circular hydrogen economy, this research â€¦"

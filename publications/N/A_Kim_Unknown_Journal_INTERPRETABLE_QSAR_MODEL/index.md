abstract: "After the twentieth century, over a million chemicals were utilized without testing their toxicity. Quantitative Structureâ€“Activity Relationships (QSAR), one of the in silico testing, can reduce time and cost comparing with traditional in vivo testing. In recent years, advances in machine learning have enabled the analysis of a broad variety of molecular descriptors for QSAR studies. However, conventional molecular descriptors based QSAR models are unable to directly exploit the three-dimensional information included in a molecule's structure. Additionally, the machine learning algorithm has a disadvantage of less interpretability. In this context, this study proposes a development of a Structure-to-Toxicity (S2T)-transformer QSAR model based on Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) to predict toxicity index of PCBs. S2T transformer trained directly SMILES which indicates the molecular structure of PCBs. Moreover, attention mechanism in transformer architecture allows S2T transformer to interpret the correlation between molecular structure and KOW to overcome the disadvantage of machine learning algorithm. The proposed SMILES based S2T-transformer QSAR model indicated the higher predictive performance of 0.83 R2 score. Also, S2T-transformer QSAR model interpreted the atom contribution of the molecular structure by attention weights in the transformer architecture."

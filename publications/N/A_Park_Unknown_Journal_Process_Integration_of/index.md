abstract: "Modified Sulphur Iodine cycle and air separation process, and Haber-Bosch process are integrated to produce ammonia and sulphuric acid. Hydrogen and sulphuric acid are produced by Modified Sulphur Iodine cycle. In this study, the economic assessment and Heat Integration were performed on three integrated processes to identify the heat requirement. Furthermore, the cost of a separate ammonia plant and the sulphuric acid plant was compared to the integrated processes. The air is separated into nitrogen and oxygen through the membrane pressure swing adsorption process. Hydrogen and nitrogen intermediate products are combined with product ammonia by Haber-Bosch process. Three processes are simulated by the commercial chemical simulator, ASPEN PLUS. Heat Pinch technique was implemented to combined Modified Sulphur Iodine cycle, air separation, and ammonia production process to integrate the heat. As a result, the process scheme for the production of two important chemicals was provided with process Integration. Reduced cooling (73%), heating (59%), and total duty (34%) requirements are expected when the Heat Integration technique was applied to the system. The economic assessment result showed that the capital cost and operating cost were expected to be reduced by 32% and 23% when the intensification of ammonia and modified sulphur iodine cycle was applied."
